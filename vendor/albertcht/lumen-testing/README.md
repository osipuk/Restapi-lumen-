## Description

A testing suite for Lumen like Laravel does.

### Requirements

* \>= PHP 7.1
* \>= Lumen 5.3

### Installation

```
composer require --dev albertcht/lumen-testing
```

* Make your test case extend `AlbertCht\Lumen\Testing\TestCase`

You're all done! Enjoy your testing like in Laravel!

### Concerns

There are some traits you can use in your test case (including original ones in Lumen):

* `AlbertCht\Lumen\Testing\Concerns\RefreshDatabase`
* `AlbertCht\Lumen\Testing\Concerns\WithFaker`
* `AlbertCht\Lumen\Testing\Concerns\InteractsWithRedis`
* `Laravel\Lumen\Testing\DatabaseMigrations`
* `Laravel\Lumen\Testing\DatabaseTransactions`
* `Laravel\Lumen\Testing\WithoutMiddleware`
* `Laravel\Lumen\Testing\WithoutEvents`

> `RefreshDatabase` = `DatabaseMigrations` + `DatabaseTransactions`, so if you use `RefreshDatabase`, you don't need to use the other two traits anymore.

### Response Assertions

Laravel provides a variety of custom assertion methods for your [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) tests. These assertions may be accessed on the response that is returned from the `json`, `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` test methods:

`$response->assertStatus($code);`  |  Assert that the response has a given code.
`$response->assertRedirect($uri);`  |  Assert that the response is a redirect to a given URI.
`$response->assertHeader($headerName, $value = null);`  |  Assert that the given header is not present on the response.
`$response->assertHeaderMissing($headerName);`  |  Assert that the given header is present on the response.
`$response->assertCookie($cookieName, $value = null);`  |  Assert that the response contains the given cookie.
`$response->assertPlainCookie($cookieName, $value = null);`  |  Assert that the response contains the given cookie (unencrypted).
`$response->assertCookieExpired($cookieName);`  |  Assert that the response contains the given cookie and it is expired.
`$response->assertCookieNotExpired($cookieName);`  |  Assert that the response contains the given cookie and it is not expired.

`$response->assertExactJson(array $data);`  |  Assert that the response contains an exact match of the given JSON data.
`$response->assertJsonStructure(array $structure);`  |  Assert that the response has a given JSON structure.
`$response->assertJsonValidationErrors($keys);`  |  Assert that the response has the given JSON validation errors for the given keys.
`$response->assertViewIs($value);`  |  Assert that the given view was returned by the route.

`$response->assertSeeTextInOrder(array $values);`  |  Assert that the given strings are contained in order within the response text.

### Authentication Assertions

Laravel also provides a variety of authentication related assertions for your [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) tests:
